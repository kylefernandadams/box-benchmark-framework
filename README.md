Box Benchmark Framework
==================
The Box Benchmark Framework project's allows you to create load tests with the [Box Java SDK](https://github.com/box/box-java-sdk), REST Endpoints, and more leveraging Apache JMeter. 

Apache JMeter
-------------
The [Apache JMeterâ„¢](http://jmeter.apache.org/) application is an open source project designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance.

2. Enable or disable test plans to run by commenting/uncomment out each test plan in the [pom.xml](/pom.xml#L114) file. 

Run Options - JMeter GUI
-------------
* This is useful for making changes to the Test Plans or running smoke tests
```bash
mvn jmeter:configure jmeter:gui -DguiTestFile="src/test/jmeter/box_java_sdk.jmx"
```

Run Options - Command Line
-------------
* This will run all of the test plans that were commented out in the pom.xml file
```bash
mvn clean verify
```

Reviewing Results - Command Line
-------------
1. Results will be generated in the /target/jmeter/reports/{test_plan_name} directory
2. Open the index.html file in your browser of choice

Debugging
------------
* System.out command will be written to the console.
* In addition, log files can be found in the /target/jmeter/logs directory
